We were getting some flac on our ability to produce such low quality music for low quality prices. We were unable to continue
to operate in America due to some pressure from particular ~~~industry~~~ fat cats with fancy names. So we moved our audio storage
out of the country.

We now have two hit songs you can stream on [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) and are available for sale on iTunes! So check it out!
